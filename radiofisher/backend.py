"""Stable integration metadata for downstream RadioFisher clients.

The scientific code predates package-level API versioning.  Downstream tools
must not infer support for experiment extensions from a branch name or from
the fact that arbitrary dictionary keys happen to be accepted.  This module
provides a deliberately small, immutable capability contract.
